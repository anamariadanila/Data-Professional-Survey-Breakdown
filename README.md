Created a Power BI project using a real dataset sourced from a survey of data professionals. The project showcases visuals illustrating average salary by job title, preferred programming languages, and feedback on happiness with work/life balance and salary satisfaction. 
These visualizations offer valuable insights into the landscape of data professionals' preferences and experiences, facilitating informed decision-making.
